# 3D Visualization Concept Ideas

## 1. Exploded Assembly Views
**Concept**: Interactive 3D models that can be exploded to show internal components
- **Examples**: Jet engines, pyramids, car engines, electronics
- **Features**:
  - Animate parts separating/assembling
  - Interactive sliders to control explosion distance
  - Highlight individual components with labels
  - Rotation and zoom controls
  - Step-by-step assembly instructions
- **Use Cases**: Technical documentation, educational content, product showcases

## 2. Wireframe to Textured Models (Face Mapping)
**Concept**: Transform wireframe geometries into textured models in real-time
- **Features**:
  - Start with wireframe geometry
  - Apply image textures using UV mapping
  - Morph between wireframe and textured views
  - Face tracking with webcam integration
  - Real-time texture swapping
- **Use Cases**: Avatar creation, AR filters, character customization

## 3. Flight Simulator with Cursor Controls
**Concept**: Simple flight simulator using mouse/cursor for aircraft control
- **Features**:
  - Mouse position controls pitch and roll
  - Constrained camera following aircraft
  - Procedural terrain generation
  - Cloud layers and atmospheric effects
  - HUD overlay (speed, altitude, heading)
  - Simple physics (lift, drag, gravity)
- **Control Scheme**:
  - Mouse X-axis: Roll (banking)
  - Mouse Y-axis: Pitch (climb/dive)
  - Scroll wheel: Throttle
  - Click: Fire/Boost

## 4. Racing Game with Background Track
**Concept**: Arcade-style racing with cursor steering
- **Features**:
  - Car model with physics-based steering
  - Infinite looped track using modular segments
  - Mouse X-axis for steering
  - Parallax background layers
  - Particle effects (dust, exhaust, sparks)
  - Checkpoint system
  - Speed boost zones
- **Visual Style**: Retro arcade or realistic

## 5. Additional Concepts

- Particle systems reacting to beat
- Genre-specific themes
- User-uploaded audio support

## Technical Stack
- **Core**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (minimal)
- **Physics**: Cannon.js or Rapier
- **Post-processing**: @react-three/postprocessing
