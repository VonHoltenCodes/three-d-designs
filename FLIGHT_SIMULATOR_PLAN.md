# Flight Simulator Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create an interactive 3D flight simulator using Three.js and React Three Fiber with cursor-based controls, procedural terrain, and atmospheric effects.

## Core Features

### 1. Aircraft Model & Controls
- **Aircraft Types**: Start with simple fighter jet, add more later
- **Control System**:
  - Mouse X-axis: Roll (banking left/right)
  - Mouse Y-axis: Pitch (nose up/down)
  - Scroll wheel: Throttle control
  - Space bar: Boost/afterburner
  - Click: Fire projectiles (optional)
- **Physics**:
  - Simplified lift and drag
  - Gravity effects
  - Stall mechanics at low speed
  - Banking turns affect heading

### 2. Camera System
- **Third-person view**: Default, follows behind aircraft
- **Cockpit view**: First-person from pilot seat
- **Free camera**: Debug mode for screenshots
- **Smooth following**: Lerped position and rotation
- **Dynamic FOV**: Increases with speed for sense of velocity

### 3. Environment
- **Terrain Generation**:
  - Perlin noise for height maps
  - Chunked loading system
  - Multiple biomes (mountains, valleys, water)
  - LOD (Level of Detail) for performance
- **Sky System**:
  - Dynamic skybox
  - Volumetric clouds (multiple layers)
  - Day/night cycle (optional)
  - Atmospheric fog
- **Weather Effects**:
  - Wind affecting flight
  - Turbulence zones
  - Rain/snow particles

### 4. HUD (Heads-Up Display)
- **Flight Instruments**:
  - Altitude indicator
  - Speed indicator
  - Artificial horizon
  - Heading compass
  - Throttle gauge
- **Targeting Reticle**: Follows mouse position
- **Mini-map**: Top-down view of terrain

### 5. Visual Effects
- **Particle Systems**:
  - Engine exhaust/afterburner
  - Vapor trails at high speed
  - Explosion effects
  - Dust when flying low
- **Post-processing**:
  - Motion blur at high speed
  - Bloom for sun and explosions
  - Depth of field for distant objects
  - Screen shake during maneuvers

### Key Dependencies
```json
{
  "three": "^0.160.0",
  "@react-three/fiber": "^8.15.0",
  "@react-three/drei": "^9.88.0",
  "@react-three/postprocessing": "^2.15.0",
  "simplex-noise": "^4.0.0",
  "leva": "^0.9.35"  // For debug controls
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Flight (Week 1)
- [ ] Setup Next.js project structure
- [ ] Create basic aircraft model
- [ ] Implement mouse controls
- [ ] Add following camera
- [ ] Simple physics (velocity, gravity)

### Phase 2: Environment (Week 2)
- [ ] Procedural terrain with Perlin noise
- [ ] Basic skybox and lighting
- [ ] Fog and distance rendering
- [ ] Chunked terrain loading

### Phase 3: Polish & Effects (Week 3)
- [ ] HUD overlay with flight data
- [ ] Particle effects (exhaust, trails)
- [ ] Post-processing pipeline
- [ ] Sound effects (engine, wind)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
- [ ] Multiple aircraft models
- [ ] Weather system
- [ ] Missions/objectives
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Performance Considerations
- **LOD System**: Reduce polygon count for distant objects
- **Frustum Culling**: Don't render outside camera view
- **Instanced Rendering**: For repeated objects (trees, clouds)
- **Texture Atlasing**: Combine textures to reduce draw calls
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse particle effects

## Control Scheme Details
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for control system
const sensitivity = 0.002
aircraft.rotation.z = mouseX * sensitivity * 2  // Roll
aircraft.rotation.x = -mouseY * sensitivity     // Pitch
aircraft.velocity += throttle * aircraft.forward
aircraft.position += aircraft.velocity * deltaTime
```

## Inspiration & References
- **Ace Combat** series (arcade flight)
- **Star Fox** (on-rails sections)
- **Pilot Wings** (free flight)
- **Top Gun** (cinematic camera angles)

## MVP Checklist
